Live Education has become more and more popular nowadays. However, little has been done to distinguish the attention status and learning effects of the audiences. In this project we proposed an Attention Monitoring and Alarming System based on Brainwave Analysis and Compuer Vision Technology. With a Mindwave and PC camera, the system will automatically remind the audience when he/she is losing focus. It will also alarm the teachers when most of audiences are distracted.
